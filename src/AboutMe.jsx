                Hi, I am a passionate Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering
                from Lovely Professional University. Currently, I am enhancing my skills at ValueLabs, where I develop
                robust solutions and contribute to high-impact projects. My expertise spans across various technologies,
                including JavaScript, Python, Java, React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, Spring Boot, and AWS.

                <br/><br/>

                At ValueLabs, I have successfully built an order management system with multiple processing steps,
                improved task tracking services, and integrated AWS services for a real-time ecommerce platform. My work
                on a data visualization interface using React and Redux received multiple client appreciations for its
                structured and component-based design.

                <br/><br/>

                I also take pride in my personal projects, including a full-stack ecommerce application and a blogging
                platform. These projects showcase my ability to design and implement comprehensive solutions using
                React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS.

                <br/><br/>

                Recognized for my performance and design excellence, I have received awards such as Shutter Riser and
                Star of the Month. My dedication to delivering high-quality solutions and my strong problem-solving
                skills drive me to continually improve and innovate in the field of software development.
